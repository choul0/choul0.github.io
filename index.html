    <p>Hello! My name is Louis Chou, and I'm currently a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Business
        Administration with a concentration in Fintech at Northeastern University. As a kid, I've always enjoyed making
        things; be it structures with Lego, drawings with crayon, or even music with instruments. This love for creation
        stayed with me throughout my education and eventually developed into interests in programming. I always remember
        the look in my friends' faces when I show them a cool new program I made for my NXT robot, or have them "play
        test" my personal project/game for computer science classes. Now, with more tool in my arsenal than ever before,
        I'm excited to once again share the things, programing related or not, that I've created. For this website, I
        wanted to eventually add the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Better formatting</li>
        <li>More sub-pages</li>
        <li>Custom JS buttons</li>
        <li>Works/graphs I create from DS 4200</li>
    </ul>
